👋 Hello, I'm Samarth!

🎓 I'm a recent graduated student in Computer Science from SRM University, with a strong focus on Java development. Over the past 1.5 years, I've honed my skills in Spring Boot, working on various projects, including building complex APIs and large-scale applications.

💼 My professional experience includes working as a Java Developer and Database Specialist at SourceBow Technologies, where I contributed to developing large-scale e-commerce websites. Additionally, I have experience in DevOps and am expanding my knowledge in AWS DevOps and ServiceNow.

🌐 I've also taken on leadership roles, having led a community of over 1,000 members as an AWS Cloud Captain. In this role, I organized events, led teams, and collaborated on real-world projects related to cloud computing.

🔍 I'm currently building a search API for Makersharks, allowing buyers to search for manufacturers based on specific criteria such as location and manufacturing capabilities.

🚀 My short-term goal is to secure a tech internship, and in the long run, I'm aiming for a well-paid software engineering job in a big tech company.
